If you want to run my code for your own Spotify data, you will need to create an [Spotify developers account](https://developers.spotify.com) and create an app to have a Client ID and Client Secrete code.

If you want to run this code with your data, you should create a secret.json file and add your credentials in the following way:

```python
{"client_id": "your Spotify client ID here",
    "client_secret": "your Spotify Secret Key here"}
```
